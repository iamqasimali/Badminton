## Code Style
I am developing this project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This involves dividing the code into three main components:
- Model: The database schemas, define the structure of the data.
- View: The frontend pages and components where all the frontend rendering occurs.
- Controller: The methods and functions are connected with all the necessary routes.
- I have used Prettier, an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing the code and re-printing it with its own rules, taking the maximum line length 
into account and wrapping code when necessary.
- My naming convention involves using names that uniquely identify the variable and method, following the Camel Case naming convention.
